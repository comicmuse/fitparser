I'm running the London Marathon on 26 April 2026.

I'm training using a Stryd training plan, targetting power.

Whenever interpreting Stryd data, my weight is configured to 61Kg on my Stryd pod,
so if you're doing any maths, bear that in mind. There's no need to tell me about
this or explain it to me, just use it in your calculations.
